## üöÄ What I Learned

Building this application was a fantastic introduction to the core concepts of Flutter. Key takeaways include:

* **Project Structure:** Understanding the basic layout of a Flutter project, including the `main.dart` file and the `pubspec.yaml` file for managing assets like custom fonts and images.
* **Widgets:** Gaining hands-on experience with fundamental widgets, such as:
    * `Scaffold`: For the basic app structure.
    * `Column`: To arrange UI elements vertically.
    * `CircleAvatar`: For creating the circular profile picture.
    * `Text`: For displaying text and styling it with `TextStyle`.
    * `Card` & `ListTile`: To create organized and elevated UI cards for contact information.
    * `Icon`: To add visual cues for contact methods.
    * `Divider`: For visual separation of UI elements.
* **Layout & Styling:** Learning how to control layout with `mainAxisAlignment` and manage spacing with `EdgeInsets` for margins and padding.
* **Stateless Widgets:** Understanding the concept of a `StatelessWidget` for building UI components that don't depend on mutable state.
